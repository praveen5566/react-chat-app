# Simple Chat Application using React Hooks.
* To start the application `npm install` Node dependencies and run `npm start`.
* This will open up the chat application on port 3000 on your browser.
* There are few lint erros with react-hooks/exhaustive-deps which can be reolved by following [this][https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-it-safe-to-omit-functions-from-the-list-of-dependencies] pattern.
* Adding unit tests, integration tests, logging and tracking functionality can be a good addition to maintain the code base.
